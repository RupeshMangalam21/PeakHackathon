Project: Blockchain-Powered Shoe Authenticity Verification and Ownership Transfer

Project Overview:
The project aims to develop a blockchain-powered web application for verifying the authenticity and managing ownership of premium shoes. Using blockchain (Ethereum), the application will store hashes of shoe details, generated at the factory and scanned by the first owner. Subsequent owners can transfer ownership securely with verification from the previous owner and the shoe company.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: TypeScript, React Native for Web
Backend: Node.js
Blockchain: Ethereum (Solidity for smart contracts)

Features:

Authentication and User Management:

Secure user registration and login.
Role-based access control (admin, verified user, etc.).


Shoe Registration and Verification:

Shoe details (brand, model, size, etc.) and images registered at the factory.
Unique hash (SHA-256) generated and stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
Barcode or QR code generated at the factory containing the shoe's hash.


Ownership Transfer:

First owner registers by scanning the barcode/QR code.
Subsequent owners initiate ownership transfer with two-sided verification:
Verification by the previous owner.
Verification by the shoe company (manufacturer or authorized entity).
Transfer recorded on the blockchain with a history log visible to all parties.


Authenticity Verification:

Public access to verify shoe authenticity by:
Inputting shoe details or scanning the barcode/QR code.
Comparing the scanned hash with the blockchain record.
Displaying verification results (authentic or not authentic).

User Interface:

Intuitive UI/UX design using React Native for Web.
Support for mobile and desktop browsers.
Barcode/QR code scanning capability using device cameras for verification.


Blockchain Integration:

Solidity smart contracts manage shoe registration, ownership transfer, and verification logic.
Web3.js for interacting with Ethereum blockchain (transactions, data retrieval).
Architecture:
Frontend: React Native for Web with TypeScript for type safety.
Backend: Node.js with Express for RESTful APIs.
Blockchain: Ethereum network for storing shoe hashes and managing ownership via smart contracts.


Development Steps:

Planning and Design:

Define user stories, requirements, and UI/UX wireframes.
Design database schema for user, shoe data, and ownership history.


Frontend Development:

Set up React Native for Web project.
Implement user authentication, shoe registration, and verification screens.
Integrate barcode/QR code scanning functionality.


Backend Development:

Develop Node.js server with Express.
Create RESTful APIs for user management, shoe registration, ownership transfer, and verification.
Integrate with Ethereum blockchain using Web3.js for smart contract interaction.


Blockchain Development:

Write Solidity smart contracts for shoe registration, ownership transfer, and verification.
Test and deploy smart contracts to Ethereum testnet (e.g., Rinkeby).


Integration and Testing:

Integrate frontend with backend APIs and barcode/QR code scanning libraries.
Conduct comprehensive testing of functionality, including ownership transfer workflows and verification processes.
Perform security audits and code reviews.


Deployment:

Deploy frontend and backend to suitable hosting platforms (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
Deploy smart contracts to Ethereum mainnet or selected testnet.


Considerations:

Security: Implement robust authentication mechanisms and validate user inputs.
Scalability: Design architecture to handle increased user traffic and transaction volumes.
Regulatory Compliance: Ensure adherence to legal requirements concerning digital ownership and consumer protection.



Team:
Project Manager: Oversees project execution and coordinates tasks.
Frontend Developer: Implements user interfaces and integrates scanning functionality.
Backend Developer: Develops server logic and integrates with blockchain.
Blockchain Developer: Writes smart contracts and ensures blockchain integration.

Resources:
Tools: VS Code, Git/GitHub, Web3.js, barcode/QR code scanning libraries (e.g., QuaggaJS).
Platforms: Ethereum blockchain, AWS or Heroku for hosting.
